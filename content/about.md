Hi, my name is Rajat Arora. I’m curious by design.

I just _have_ to know what it is about music that humans enjoy, or why does a CPU heat up, or why does a car’s AC run better when it is moving, or what goes on with light inside a DSLR camera. You get the picture.

I caught the nerd bug early on. When kids my age were discovering cricket bats, I was busy playing with batteries and bulbs. At 8, I tried to replace a light switch on my own (and received a well-deserved, 220V electric shock in return!). I wrote my first piece of HTML at 11, became a bookworm at 13, and transformed a 400-word English homework into a 10,000-word monstrosity at 15.

These days I work as an Engineering Manager at [Zest](https://www.zestmoney.in/), where I help integrate Zest's platform with its various lending partners. Prior to Zest I have done stints with startups like [Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com/), internet behemoths like [naukri.com](https://www.naukri.com/), and a product/consulting shop like [Indus Valley Partners](https://www.ivp.in/).

Outside of work, I hoard gadgets and collect fountain pens. Reading books is my favorite pastime. My Kindle Voyage is my constant companion, come rain or shine. I cannot turn in for the day without reading at least a few pages. I also listen to a lot of music, and a lot of podcasts ([99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/) is among my all-time favorites!)

On this plot of online space I like to write about stuff that interests me. I use writing as a tool to reflect, some of which may end up posted here. I may also write about my favorite software programs, my favorite books, my favorite podcasts, my favorite movies, my favorite investment vehicles, my favorite gadgets… and also write some unsolicited advice to wash it all down! It is all very shady and up in smoke right now, but I’m sure I’ll develop a definite voice as we go along.

Welcome to this weird journey. :smile:
