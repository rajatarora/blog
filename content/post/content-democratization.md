Lately, I have been watching a lot of movies on different OTT platforms. (I have a terrible case of FOMO, so I insist on buying subscriptions to as many of them as possible). And with the sheer number of movies I have been watching, I also maintain my watchlist (and _watched_ list) on [JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com/), because _God Forbid I Watch The Same Movie Twice[^1]_ :anger:. 

It is in these past few months that I have noticed something. Content, _especially_ entertainment content in video form, has been highly democratised since the emergence of different OTT platforms.

Before Netflix, any time you wanted to watch a movie, you would have had to do one of these things:

- Watch it in a movie theatre. Tough luck if its theatrical run is over.
- Buy/Rent a DVD. Sucks if you were on a budget.
- Borrow the DVD from a friend. What if your friends don't have the same taste in movies as you?
- Watch a CAM rip online. Spend hours searching for it and then squint your eyes in front of a blurry print.
- Download it from shady sites or via a torrent. Get a free virus with every movie. :smirk:

This has become _way_ easier after Netflix. The lesser mortals need to google the movie's name, and the almighty search engine shows a link to the streaming service carrying it. If you're like me and _have 'em all_, you can just click through and start watching.

The _better_ mortals use [JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com/)[^2] :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

This proliferation of OTT platforms has created a delightful _unintended_ consequence &mdash;Â now, _all sorts_ of movies are available to stream online. Blockbusters, Art House, Classics, Satire, World Cinema, Indie, Experimental, Regional, Film Noir... you name it.

This has opened up the number of movies I can enjoy.

Three years ago, I would have _never_ had a reason to search for, let alone _download_, a movie like [Minari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minari_(film)), [Ahaan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahaan) or [Kuch Bheege Alfaaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuchh_Bheege_Alfaaz). I would have never known that they even existed.

The traditional movie marketing machine only works for those big-budget _Sallu Bhai_ movies. The discovery of the other, lesser-known film is left to word-of-mouth publicity only, especially in the non-OTT era.

These days you can plug in a [Netflix Genre Code](https://www.netflix-codes.com/) and find a _different_ movie to watch every day. Discover the gems that would have otherwise never been on your radar.

It's not all sunshine and roses, though. The problem with the many OTT platforms is that they are _many_. Those subscriptions can add up. And movie titles have a way of hopping between different platforms and even dropping out of everywhere. It is frustrating, but ultimately much more minor than being in a non-OTT world.

I would not dream of a world with only one or just a few platforms. That will give them too much bargaining power against the small and independent movie producers. Either their films would be de-platformed, or the revenue-sharing agreements would be stacked against them. Creativity will suffer either way. Artists make good films and work better when they don't have to think about earning the next meal alongside their creative process.

[^1]: This is at times not the case. I _do_ watch the same movie multiple times. I'm looking at you, Midnight in Paris. And you, Jab We Met!
