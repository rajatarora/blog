I've always felt that I think better when I'm writing down my thoughts during the process. A pencil and a notebook go a long way in making me properly articulate whatever it is that I want to say.

I usually start by writing a single word at the center of a blank page, and then I try to connect it to a bunch of more words. (Snowflake method, anyone?) Soon I arrive at a mind-map like structure (not quite, but close) that lets me stay focused on topic. Even staring at those words help and it prevents me from distracting myself to oblivion.

Of course my ADHD is to blame for my distractedness, however, I feel that even neurotypical people can benefit from a bit of writing.
