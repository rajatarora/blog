A long time ago[^1], I used to be afraid of English.



Back when I was... what, 10 years old? I used to read a lot of magazines. It used to be my favourite pastime &mdash;Â come back from school, and read the latest issue of [Champak](https://www.champak.in/subscribe/champak-hindi) without even changing out of my uniform! And when I was finished with it, there was always [Nandan](https://theprint.in/features/brandma/nandan-the-childrens-magazine-that-is-more-a-collectors-item-for-todays-generations/515490/), and [Bal Bharti](https://bharatkosh.gov.in/Product/ProductDetails/1/4/PD/Bal-Bharti), and even [Awishkar](http://nrdcindia.com/ProductDetails/2)! Yes, I was as a read-freak back then as I am today.



All of these
