I'm not particularly new to this _blogging_ world. If my memory serves me right, I had published my first blog post fifteen years ago! Sadly, that particular post (and that particular blog) does not exist today. Heck, I don't even remember the  URL that I can plug into [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to find out what I was writing back then.

Most probably, it was some angsty teenage shit. 

But even then, my 17-year-old self was grateful that I _had_ an outlet to express myself. Coming from a largely dysfunctional family of three, I have always turned inward to make sense of my thoughts. Writing is therapeutic for me. My best estimate says that I have written 300,000 words in my lifetime&mdash;scattered across various blogs (most of which are no longer online), private git repos, dropbox folders, Medium, and even physical notebooks. Writing is part of my identity.

_"Oh, so you write?"_ someone would say, _"Can I read something you've written?"_

_"Err... no. It's private!"_ is what I'd usually answer. Perhaps I'd dig out a page or two if a friend asked, but on the whole, I don't have a body of work to show off to the world.

And boy, do I have things to say! 

My ADHD mind is like a pointer traversing an infinitely large graph. Every node I visit opens pathways to several other nodes, and I have a hard time deep-diving into the one topic I'm supposed to be focusing on. 

This leaves me with a **lot** of unformed thoughts. I record whatever I can, and the rest relocate themselves some hundred nodes away. Maybe I'll get to visit them someday, maybe not.

This 2022 version of [rajat.co](https://rajat.co) is my humble attempt to bring some organisation to my distracted mind. It's an online space for me to spit out whatever the fuck the neurons inside my brain are doing. It is going to serve two purposes:

- I get to build a public body of work over time. The first few months will be challenging and probably riddled with teething problems. I will have to make a whole new set of habits and rein in my mind enough to be able to write whatever I'm thinking. However, I do expect things to get better over time.
- I get to bring all those runaway nodes a little closer. I will be the most prolific _reader_ of this blog too. Now that ~~all~~ most of my essential thoughts will be recorded here, I'll be able to latch on to them sooner.

Ultimately I will split all text here into two major sections: _blog posts_ and _notes_. Notes will be linked to each other in [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) style, while _blog posts_ will be long-form articles that will evolve from those notes. This site will, it means, be a combination of a personal wiki and a blog. 

Now all that remains is that I maintain enough momentum to keep this going for a non-trivial amount of time!
